    "This error is very common case case in Jupyter Notebooks and hence it's important to understand. Quite often when you restart your notebook and run a cell in the middle of the notebook, you'll see a similar type of error whose name is not definied. That happens because when you restart your notebook, it's context is reset; and if you don't have the variable defined in the same cell, the variable does not exist in the scope of the notebook. All the cells have the same scope, but the way variables are populated is determined by the running order of notebook cells."
