    "A Python `set` is an _unordered_ collection: the elements of a set do not have a position or order, so you cannot do indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like operations on sets as you would do on, for instance, lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Python mimic mathematical sets: the elements do not repeat. They are especially handy if you have other collections, like lists or tuples, and need to create a new collection of unique values, or the union of two collections, or a a super**set** (you see, **set** here is not a coincidence!).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods (functions) available for a set, but there is also a rich collection of _overloaded operators_, too. That includes '**`&`**', '**`|`**', '**`-`**', and others, which correspond to their \"natural\" mathematical analogues. Here are some of the most useful of those overloaded operations:\n",
    "* **`A <= B`** or **`A < B`**: Check if `A` is a (proper) subset of `B`\n",
    "* **`A >= B`** / **`A > B`**: Check if `A` is a (proper) superset of `B`\n",
    "* **`A | B`**: Compute the union of two sets\n",
    "* **`A & B`**: Intersection\n",
    "* **`A - B`**: Difference\n",
    "* **`A ^ B`**: Symmetric difference\n",

    "As usual, you can read more about that in the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set). Below are some examples of several set operations:"
