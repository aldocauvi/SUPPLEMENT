    "Sets are super handy if you have several collections, like lists or tuples, and need to create a new collection that does not have any repeating elements, or that is union of two collection, or a super**set** (you see, **set** here is not a coincedence!).\n",
    "Thing that usually get unnoticed by a python newbie is that in addition to tons of methods that sets support they also use operator overloading. That means that common operators like '**&**', '**|**', '**-**', and others are rewritten to maintain operations specific for sets (and those that make sense for guys who know how sets work). Here are that operations:\n",
    "* **<=** / **<** - is subset\n",
    "* **>=** / **>** - is superset\n",
    "* **|** - union\n",
    "* **&** - intersection\n",
    "* **-** - difference\n",
    "* **^** - symmetric difference\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, you can read more about that in the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set). Below are some examples of several set operations:"
