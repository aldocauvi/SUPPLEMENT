    "Many a times, we hear discussions about writing programs using Python in the \"most Pythonic way.\" Sometimes it's more of a philosophy; however, quite often there might be a more concrete message: \"Do not re-invent the wheel.\" Indeed, Python is a wonderful language full of lots of built-in libraries. If you need anything, it is most likely implemented in the language. It takes no more than a dozen lines of code to solve many common problems. This is the result of Python's \"batteries included\" approach to design of the language and libraries.\n",
