    "## Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is essentially an iterator over an object (say a dataset). You get a small chunk of data obtained through \"iterating over the larger object\" every time you make a call to the generator. Generators might prove to be useful in your implementation of sequential training algorithms where you only require a few samples of your data. For example, in a mini batch stochastic gradient descent, you would need to generate random samples from the dataset for performing an update on your gradient. Generators can be used in such use cases to create memory efficient implementations of your algorithm, since they allow you to perform operations without loading the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also see PEP 255 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/). The explanation presented here is quite thorough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behaviour of generators\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator behaves like a function with states. Typically, functions in Python do not have any state information. The variables defined within the function scope are reset/destroyed at the end of every function call. A generator allows you store intermediate states between calls, so that every subsequent call can resume from the last state of execution. Generators introduced the `yield` keyword to Python. We will look at a few examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although generators use the `def` keyword, they are not function objects. Generators are a class in their own right, but are slightly different from function objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a look at our first generator."
